# Tensors

### **What are Tensors?**
- A **tensor** is a specialized multi-dimensional array used for mathematical and computational operations.
- Tensors can be considered as a generalization of scalars (single values), vectors (1D arrays), and matrices (2D arrays) to higher dimensions.
- They are a fundamental data structure in **machine learning** and **deep learning**.

### **Why are Tensors Useful?**
- **Efficient Computation:** Optimized for parallel computations using GPUs.
- **Multi-Dimensional Representation:** Can represent **scalars, vectors, matrices, and higher-dimensional arrays**.
- **Flexibility in Operations:** Supports **element-wise operations, matrix multiplication, and complex algebraic transformations**.
- **Interoperability with Machine Learning Frameworks:** Used in **PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy**, etc.

### **Why are Tensors Used in Deep Learning?**
1. **Handling Large Data Efficiently**  
   - Deep learning models process large datasets; tensors help manage data in a structured manner.
   
2. **GPU Acceleration**  
   - Tensors allow for fast parallel computations, making deep learning feasible for large models.

3. **Backpropagation & Differentiation**  
   - PyTorchâ€™s **autograd** feature enables automatic differentiation of tensor operations, essential for training neural networks.

4. **Efficient Computation of Weights and Biases**  
   - Neural networks involve **matrix multiplications** and **vector transformations**, which are easily handled by tensors.

5. **Seamless Conversion Between Libraries**  
   - Tensors can be converted between **NumPy arrays**, **Pandas DataFrames**, and **Torch tensors**.

### **Tensors in PyTorch**
- PyTorch provides a **Tensor class** that enables various tensor operations.
- Tensors in PyTorch are similar to NumPy arrays but optimized for **GPU acceleration**.

#### **Creating Tensors in PyTorch**
```python
import torch

# Creating a tensor
tensor_1 = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
print(tensor_1)

# Creating a matrix (2D tensor)
tensor_2 = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print(tensor_2)

# Creating a random tensor
random_tensor = torch.rand(3, 3)  # 3x3 matrix with random values
print(random_tensor)

# Converting NumPy array to PyTorch tensor
import numpy as np
numpy_array = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
tensor_from_numpy = torch.from_numpy(numpy_array)
print(tensor_from_numpy)
```

#### **Common Tensor Operations**
```python
# Element-wise addition
a = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
b = torch.tensor([4, 5, 6])
c = a + b
print(c)  # Output: tensor([5, 7, 9])

# Matrix multiplication
A = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = torch.tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
C = torch.matmul(A, B)
print(C)

# Reshaping tensors
x = torch.rand(2, 3)
y = x.view(3, 2)  # Reshape to 3x2 matrix
print(y)

# Moving tensors to GPU
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
tensor_gpu = torch.rand(3, 3).to(device)
print(tensor_gpu)
```

### **Tensor Types in PyTorch**
| Type | Description |
|------|------------|
| `torch.FloatTensor` | 32-bit floating point |
| `torch.DoubleTensor` | 64-bit floating point |
| `torch.IntTensor` | 32-bit integer |
| `torch.LongTensor` | 64-bit integer |

To specify the data type:
```python
tensor_float = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=torch.float32)
tensor_int = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3], dtype=torch.int32)
```

---

### **Gradient Computation with Autograd**
```python
x = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True)  # Enable autograd
y = x**3 + 3*x  # Function
y.backward()  # Compute gradients
print(x.grad)  # dy/dx = 3x^2 + 3
```
