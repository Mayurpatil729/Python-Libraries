Introduction to Matplotlib:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A picture is worth a thousand words.

Numpy--->  Data Analysis library
Pandas---> Data Analysis library/Data Visualization

Matplotlib/ Seaborn/plotly[most advanced]--->Data visualization libraries

Advantage :
We can identify relationships very easily.
We can identify differences very easily.
We can identify patterns so that we can do predictions very easily.
 

Matplotlib Introduction:
most popular and oldest visualization library. Python's alternative to MATLAB.
1. It is freeware and open source.
2. 2-D graphs and 3-D graphs.
3. static graphs, interactive visualizations, animations.
4. Jhon Hunter on top of numpy and sidePy libraries
5. All advanced python's data visualization libraries are depends on matplotlib.
    Very large community support is there.
6. official website: https : //matplotlib.org
    Examples code for every graph availabld

Line Plots-Basics:
1. Types of plots
2. Line plots

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Types of plots:
Several types of plots/graphs are supported by matplotlib.
The main important are:
1. Line plots
2. Bar charts
3. Pie charts
4. Histograms
5. Scatter plots
etc.

Based on our requirement and available input data, we can choose corresponding plot/graph.

matplotlib library contains pyplot module
pyplot module defines several functions to plot data in visual form.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can create plots in 2 approaches:
1. Functional way/procedural way(pyplot)
For small data sets
2. Object Oriented way
Larger data sets
