⟫⇛ Numpy is a python package which stands for " Numerical python Library ":
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

⟫⇛ This was created in 2005 by travis Oliphant
It is the fundamental python library to perform complex numerical operations.
⟫⇛Numpy is developed on top of Numeric Library.
⟫⇛Numeric Library developed by "" Jim Hugunin "".
⟫⇛Numpy is developed by Travis Oliphant and multiple contributors.
⟫⇛Numpy is freeware and open source library.

==> provides efficient storage
==> provides better ways of handling data for processing
==> it is fast, easy to learn
==> relatively less memory to store data
==> used for scientific calculations.
==> it is faster than python list.
==> it has built in functions for linear Algebra random number generation.
==> fourier transforms and routines for shape manipulation.

⟫⇛ 1 dimensionnal array  ⟫⇛ vector
⟫⇛ 2 dimensionnal array  ⟫⇛ Matrix
⟫⇛ 3 dimensionnal array  ⟫⇛ Tensor

===================================================================

⟫⇛  Need of numpy  ⇚⟪
==> Creation of Arrays/Matrices
==> Perform several operations on arrays/matrices
==> perform integral calculus operations
==> Solving Differential equations
==> Statistics related operations etc

Wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays.
It supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that
operate on these arrays and matrices.
mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, 1/0,
discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical
operations, random simulation and much more.

⟫⇛ What are various Features of Numpy?
1. Numpy is superfast because it is written in C language.
2. Numpy acts as backbone for Data Science Libraries like pandas, scikit-learn etc
   Pandas internally used 'nd array' to store data, which is numpy data structure.
   Scikit-learn internally used numpy's nd array.
3.Numpy has vectori±ation feature which improves performance while iterating
   elements.

⟫⇛ What is nd array in Numpy?
In Numpy, we can hold data by using Array Data Structure.
The arrays which are created by using numpy are called nd arrays.
>N-Dimensiona1 Array or Numpy Array
nd array this nd array is most comonly used in Data Science Libraries like pandas,
learn etc
==========================================================================================

⟫⇛ Application Areas of Numpy? 
To perform lineral algebra functions.
To perform linear regression.
To perform logistic regression.
Deep Neural Networks
K-means Clustering
Control Systems
Operational Reasearch

===================================================================

⟫⇛ What topics will be covered as the part of this numpy ?
Creation of Numpy Array
Array Operations
Array Attributes
Array Indexing and Slicing
Broadcasting
Iterating Over Array
Binary Condition
Copy and View
Sort and Search
Statistics related functions
Linear Algebra functions

===================================================================

What is an Array?
An indexed collection of homogeneous data elements is nothing but array.
It is the most commonly used concept in programming languages like C/C++/Java etc

===================================================================

Python List vs Numpy Arrays:
===================================================================
1.Similarities 
2.Differences 
3.Advantage of arrays
===================================================================
Similarities arrays between python List and Numpy Array:
1. Both can be used to store data.
2. The order will be preserved in both types index.
3. Slicing is also applicable for both. Both are mutable .
===================================================================
Differences between Python List and Numpy Array:
1. List is inbuilt data type but numpy array is not inbuilt.have to install and import numpy library explicitly.
   To use numpy arrays, we HAVE to install and import numpy explicitly
2.List can hold heterogeneous (Different types) elements.
      eg 1 = [10,20.5,True,'durga']
  Array can hold only homogeneous elements.
      eg: a =numpy.array([10,20,30]) 
3. On arrays we can perform vector operations(the operations which can be operated
  on every element of the array). But we cannot perform vector operations on list.
4. Arrays consume less memory when compared with list.

=============================================================================

Creation of Numpy Arrays:
Numpy library contains several functions to create ndarray based on our requirement.
The following are few of such functions:
array()
arange()
zeros ( )
ones()
linspace()
eye ( )
random( )
etc
