Data Analysis==>Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing,
transforming, and modelling data with the goal of discovering
useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting
decision-making.

What is Pandas?

1.The name "pandas" has a reference to both "panel data", and "python
data analysis" and was created by wes mckinney in 2008.
2.Pandas is a python library used for working with data sets.
3.It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating
data.
4.Read and write data structures and different formats : csv,
JSON,ZIP etc.

⟫⇛ Pandas Data Structures

Three Data Structures:
1. Series: One-Dimensional labeled arrays pd.Series(data)
2. DataFrames: Two-Dimensional data structure with columns,
 much like a table.
3. Panel : A panel is a 3D container of data.

The Pandas provides two data structures for processing the
data.
Series & DataFrame and Panel

⟫⇛ Importance of Pandas in Python.
Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.
Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.
Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating
point data
Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher
dimensional objects
Data set merging and joining. Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets Provides
time-series functionality.

===================================================================

Series : It is defined as a one-dimensional array that is capable of storing
various data types.
